                        <h1>I Make Music</h1>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>I work across genres and instruments. My music has been released
                            <a href="http://zacanger.bandcamp.com">independently</a>&nbsp;and on
                            <a href="http://www.sugomusic.com">Sugo Music.</a>&nbsp;My music could best
                            be described as ADHD. I've ranged from indie
                            rock to grindcore to neo-classical downtempo chillwave. I have an equally
                            hard time sticking to one instrument; though I usually default to the guitar
                            or a PC, I'm just as comfortable behind a drum set or the mixing board.
                            I've released music under the monikers Zac Anger &amp; The Heretics, The
                            Left Project, and g|!t©H, and played with several local and regional groups
                            including The Mayor's Wife, Past Forward, and
                            <a href="http://katenyx.com">Kate Nyx</a>.</p>

                            <p>I started learning the basics of audio engineering and recording in 2005,
                                and since then self-published dozens of projects. In 2013,
                                Sugo Music Group picked up a large portion of my back catalog for commercial distribution.
                                That said, more recent projects are always released for free on
                                <a href="http://zacanger.bandcamp.com">my Bandcamp</a>&nbsp;and
                                <a href="http://soundcloud.com/zacanger">Soundcloud</a>.&nbsp;This music is released under the

                                end up covering, remixing,
                                mashing-up, or in some other way using my music to make something cool,

                            <p class="text-info">As long as I can remember I've enjoyed using computers, but it wasn't
                                until I started theming and modding my first smartphone (a Galaxy S Fascinate)
                                that I started to take a serious interest in the Open Source world (the
                                screenshots here are from my theming days). Since then I've developed a
                                strong interest in software development and design; in particular, the
                                amazing possibilities in the future of web technology.
                                <br>
                                <br>The explosion of open culture is something I deeply support both as a
                                musician and as an aspiring developer, and the influence of the Android
                                and Debian communities has had a considerable impact on my beliefs and
                                values. I'm a Debian user and Devuan supporter, and I strongly recommend
                                checking out Debian if you're still using a locked-down OS. Closed, proprietary
                                software user groups never had the sense of community and level of participation
                                that the incredible web dev groups and 'nix users have; that matters quite
                                a lot, and has a very positive effect on the quality of software as well.
                                <br>
                                <br>A lot of my life has been based around tech — like much of my generation,
                                it's just always been there, but unlike many I was raised by a designer
                                and an admin. I'm currently seeking education in web design and development,
                                which is the area of technology that I believe holds the most potential,
                                for the next several years. With the explosion of mobile computing, high
                                bandwidth connections, and computers that would've been mind-boggling ten
                                years ago but can now fit in one's back pocket, so much growth has taken
                                place in the webdev field, and the rate at which things change only seems
                                to increase. It can be mildly overwhelming, at times, but it's certainly
                                always fascinating, and never dull.</p>

                                here's a photo from when I had a nifty moustache; it has to go during summers,
                                but if you catch me in the winter you'll likely see some super classy and/or
                                amusing (depending on your preferences) facial hair.

								<br>NEW THING! <a href="http://zacanger.com/paste">Here's a super-simple pastebin thing</a> 
								I'm playing with. It has basic syntax highlighting, and a flat-file database (if that's not 
								a contradiction in terms?). Trying to learn myself some PHP. Feel free to use it for whatever,

                                devout atheist, and I'm very hardcore about my laid-back-ness; the blogs
                                often reflect that.

                                I'll be starting in an immersive education programme (bootcamp) this fall.
                                With a little luck and a lot of hardwork, hopefully I'll come out fully
                                capable of working web wizardry (or at least with a much better understanding
