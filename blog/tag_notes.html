<p>Takeaways from Laurie Voss's 'Stuff Everybody Knows Except You'</p>

<ul>
<li>Be good at your tools.
<ul>
<li>If you use Windows, be <em>good</em> at Windows. Also, don't use Windows.</li>
<li>Know Bash. Also know Sed and Awk. But really, really, <em>really</em> know Bash.</li>
<li>Be good at your editor. It doesn't matter which one. Notepad is not an editor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't fuck with users.
<ul>
<li>Paralaralaralax is the devil.</li>
<li>A button is an action. A link goes somewhere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Auth is not simple.
<ul>
<li>Identification: Hi, I'm this guy! (To people.)</li>
<li>Authentication: Hi, I can prove I'm this guy! (To a computer.)</li>
<li>Authorization: Hi, I am allowed to do these things!</li>
<li>Salt and hash your passwords. Always. (Bcrypt.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security is not a joke.
<ul>
<li>Leave it to people who know what they're doing.</li>
<li>Or devote your career to doing this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't build rich web apps for everything.
<ul>
<li>If your site is all about content, build a plain old static site.</li>
<li>This seems obvious, but apparently it's not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Load content first. Fuck your fancy fonts, fuck your gifs, just load stuff.</li>
<li>Speed over everything.</li>
<li>Write and maintain tests. Test. Write testable code.</li>
<li>Read the error logs. And write good error messages.</li>
<li>Write obvious code.</li>
<li>Get good at git.</li>
<li>Automate all the things (with deployment, but also testing, CI, and everything else).
<ul>
<li>But don't go overboard (yak shaving).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Break things up (use common patterns/modularise everything/decouple shit).
<ul>
<li>Also, keep in mind that everything you write is/has an API. Make it consistent.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I really enjoy node. This is all pretty disorganized. It's also all one giant code block, since
I took the 'notes' bit in comments. The repos mentioned are <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/node-misc">here</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/examples">here</a>. Yay.</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="closures.html">
Closures
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">February 02, 2016  &mdash; 
Zac Anger</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>A closure is a local variable for a function, which sticks around after the function has been returned.</p>

<p>(Or, a closure is a stack-frame which is <em>not deallocated</em> when the function returns [as if a 'stack-frame' were malloc'ed instead of being on the stack!]. Whatever that means.)</p>

<p>Here, let's explain in Javascript.</p>

<pre><code>function sayHi(name){
  var text = 'hi ' + name // (local var)
    , say  = function(){
    console.log(text)
    return say
  }
}
var sayIt = sayHi('zac')
sayIt() // returns 'hi zac'
</code></pre>

<p>So here, a function is returned as a variable.</p>

<p>What we're doing here is putting a function inside a function. And we're getting something accessible outside of that enclosing function, right?</p>

<p>Hence <em>closure</em>.</p>

<p>In most descendants of C, after a function returns, its local variables are <em>gone</em>. The stack-frame is gone.</p>

<p>In JS, functions that are inside other functions can still be accessed outside of (after) that parent function. Try using the above code, and then doing <code>sayIt.toString()</code>, and you'll see that the variable <code>say</code> is returned -- which is a function that references <code>text</code>, which is a variable local to <code>sayHi()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>function oneMore(){
  var i     = 1
    , logIt = function(){
    console.log(i)
  }
  i++
  return logIt
}
var logStuff = logIt()
oneMore() // 2
</code></pre>

<p>Make sense? Here's a slightly more complex example pulled straight from the interwebs.</p>

<pre><code>var logNumber, increaseNumber, setNumber
function setupGlobals(){
  var i = 4
  logNumber = function(){
    console.log(i)
  }
  increaseNumber = function(){
    i++
  }
  setNumber = function(x){
    i = x
  }
}
setupGlobals()
increaseNumber()
logNumber()     // 5
setNumber(8)
logNumber()     // 8
var oldLog = logNumber
setupGlobals()
logNumber()     // 4
oldLog()        // 8
</code></pre>

<p>Local variables from a closure will be overwritten if you call that outer function again. Don't forget this, because you can get some really screwy stuff going on if you do!</p>

<p>There is a closure for <em>every function call</em>, not for every <em>function declaration</em>. This example might help demonstrate this.</p>

<pre><code>function newClosure(fooInt, barRef){
  var num     = fooInt
    , quuxArr = [1, 2, 3]
    , ref     = barRef
  return function(x){
    num += x
    quuxArr.push(num)
    console.log('num: ' + num +
      '; quuxArr: ' + quuxArr.toString() +
      '; ref.bazVar: ' + ref.bazVar)
  }
}
obj = {bazVar: 4}
fn1 = newClosure(4, obj)
fn2 = newClosure(8, obj)
fn1(1)     // num:5; quuxArr:1,2,3,4,5; ref.bazVar: 4
fn2(1)     // num:9; quuxArr:1,2,3,8; ref.bazVar: 4
obj.bazVar++ // 4
fn1(2)     // num:7; quuxArr:1,2,3,5,7; ref.bazVar:5
fn2(2)     // num:11; quuxArr:1,2,3,9,11; ref.bazVar:5
</code></pre>

<p>So... a quick recap?</p>

<p>When a function is <em>used</em> inside another function, you've used a <em>closure</em>. This includes <code>eval()</code>. (Note that using a constructor, as in <code>new Function()</code>, does <em>not</em> create a closure.)</p>

<p>Every time you call a function with a closure, it makes a new set of those local variables.</p>

<p>Closures <em>can</em> definitely be nested.</p>

REACT NOTES
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">January 25, 2016  &mdash; 
Zac Anger</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>This is all <em>such</em> a mess, and so unsorted, so, sorry about that in advance.</p>

<p>This is also almost entirely notes from very early on in trying to learn React, so not all of it will be completely valid, probably. Okay. So.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<h4>REACT NOTES (yeah, again):</h4>

<p>There's no <code>if...else</code> in JSX. Doesn't work. Don't try it (in your JSX).</p>

<p>Don't try <code>&lt;!doctype&gt;</code> either. It'll break stuff.</p>

<p>Same with HTML comments. Not worth the trouble, I guess. No one reads them, anyway, so whatever.</p>

<p>Don't try to use your own code style. JSX needs to be written the way the docs say to. Doing React means doing React <em>their</em> way, so screw your purely stylistic preferences, they don't matter anymore. Which, unfortunately, means semicolons everywhere. Gross.</p>

<p><em>Every single XML tag needs to be closed</em>. That means that <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is invalid, but <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code> is... totally valid. Also, self-closing tags (which literally do not even exist in HTML anymore) work just fine, so <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> is valid. What the hell.</p>

<p>In JSX, <strong>everything</strong> in <code>{}</code> will be evaluated as Javascript. So you can do some things there, if you need to. (But not <code>if...else</code>!)</p>

<p>Any JSX over multiple lines needs to be wrapped in parens. If it's single-line, you don't need them.</p>

<p>Evidently it's better to indent all the stuff going in your tags just inside the tag, rather than even with the first whatchamacallit. This is what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text"
       value={whatever.stuff}
       onChange={this.foo.bar} /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...is apparently NOT the way to do it. Instead, we want to do:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input
  type="text"
  value={whatever.stuff}
  onChange={this.foo.bar} /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which, personally, I find more annoying and <em>less</em> readable, but apparently that's how the React community does, so whatever. Oh, and as to the closing of the tag, no matter what it's gonna be hideous, so I don't know or care whether it should be on a newline. Probably not, because that's just even more lines, but I have seen a lot of this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text"
  value={whatever.stuff}
  onChange={this.foo.bar}
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which is really even more annoying, but whatever. Lastly, as far as style goes, I'll just put what would make the most sense to <strong>me</strong>, personally. Note how clean and lined up things are? Yeah. Much better, to my eyes. Still ugly af, though.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text"
      value={whatever.stuff}
   onChange={this.foo.bar} /&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Bene Brown; author on subject of empathy.</p>

<h3>The Technical Bit</h3>

<p>Jordan Last, speaker on Angular, client-side storage.</p>

<p>Problem: people want wikis, but don't like the word 'wiki.' (Yes, it's more complicated, but not so much so that a wiki wouldn't handle it).</p>

<p>Organization of survey site data (BYU Archaeology Dept.) &amp;c.; Android devices, needed compat. with iOS. This fellow ended up with <a href="http://ionic.io">Ionic</a> to handle building apps.</p>

<p>Okay, new question, how to work with storage? He checked out Cordova (PhoneGap), but wasn't into SQLite so much. Wanted straight-up persistant storage in the browser.</p>

<p>What options were there? Local, IndexedDB, WebSQL. Obviously IndexedDB isn't useful for people who want to stick with that Apple Webkit crap; Local storage is okay for... a little bit of stuff. They ended up choosing WebSQL (despite its deprecation), because they're big on relational databases and didn't want to get into Mongo or Node stuff. (Sidenote, this fellow doesn't quite grasp how the W3C works, or the problems with non-standard or deprecated technologies. Oh well.) Quick rundown on the very barest basics of ORM, aka Why We're Calling This A Model.</p>

<p>Looks like he's using <a href="https://github.com/coresmart/persistencejs">Persistence JS</a>. In persistence, you would save an object like, for example:</p>

<pre><code>persistence.add(this)
persistence.flush()
callback &amp;&amp; callback()
</code></pre>

<p>And now you have your whatsit all set. That's your save method. Then, say, <code>thingy.save(function);</code> and, y'know, there you go. Oh, wait. He forgot a bit about persistence. Needs <code>schema.sync</code> and a <code>.config</code> bit to get up and working.</p>

<p>Now, to query WebSQL in this kind of screwy setup (persistence-specific):</p>

<pre><code>whatever.getStuff = function(thingPassed, maybeAnother) {
  whatever.all().filter('thingPassed', '=' whateveritis); // i suppose i missed quite a bit here
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, finally, deleting... which evidently should be pretty easy. Too easy to go over.</p>

<h4>Closing points:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Never access the DB directly--do it through lots of Javascript and boilerplate and awkward ways.</li>
<li>Keep model-specific DB stuff with the model</li>
<li>Absolutely don't need to use persistence.js or WebSQL (thank goodness)</li>
<li>Use an ORM, silly!</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and the fellow who organized this thing maybe isn't aware of other stuff going on aroud here. LunchJS would be worth looking into.</p>

<p>And this Jordan fellow is interesting. Bit enthusiastic, dresses half his age, but information architecture + comp sci + dev + project management = all the things I'm really interested in, mostly, pretty much.</p>

<p>Oh, and it was kinda neat to check out Adobe's SLC building.</p>
