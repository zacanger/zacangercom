I figure keeping this stuff on Github will encourage me to do things the right way, rather than fudging through the design and updates of my personal site.
And rather than making a new repo every time I change it (which tends to be fairly often), I'll likely just make a new branch. That's kind of sloppy, but better than having a dozen versions of the same site in different repos.
The master will always be the current live version.
