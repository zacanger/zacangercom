Hi! I'm Zac. (I promise not to say I make things.)

I'm a person! Who'd've guessed? He/him/his, mid-20s, East Coast (Baltimore born, PA raised)
kinda guy. I've been an active musician since childhoord, performing and recording with some
truly rad groups, both regional and national. In recent years, I've had the good fortune to
work with Sugo Music Group, though I have a habit of releasing my music for free for several
months before sending it off to get productized.

I have a passion for technology. I'm a GNU/Linux believer. I write on an irregular basis
about open source technology and various development-related topics (among a host of
other things). I also have a keep interest in internet technology, including (but not limited
to) security, browser development, social platforms, experience and interaction design, and,
of course, straight-up web development.

As I see it, libraries and frameworks are fluid and ephemeral, and while they're definitely
fun and useful, they're also sometimes seemingly deprecated by the time one can check the
README. Fortunately, the basics never change.
