I’m a reliable, dedicated individual with an extensive work history in a broad spectrum of fields. Technological and
creative opportunities pique my enthusiasm, in contexts both professional and personal. I’ve a solid background in
team-oriented work, and a stronger one in flying solo, in a wide variety of environments. I am, essentially, laid back;
when change occurs, I’ll adapt quickly; when someone needs to take initiative, I can do that; when group roles need
to be filled, I’m perfectly fine there as well.
Design and development are my thing, with a strong preference for web technologies. Building better interfaces and
smoother interactions, opening up the web to more people, and keeping it open for everyone; these are the things
I’m passionate about, and I do what I can to contribute to these causes. Keeping software free, development open,
business transparent, and content accessible are absolute requirements for the future of the web. If your organization
feels the same and is looking for a truly passionate candidate, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
